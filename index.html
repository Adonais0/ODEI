        <p class="para fade">In September of 2015, as one of his first official acts as president, Mark Schlissel announced that creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive campus would be among his top priorities. Then he issued an audacious challenge to the entire U-M community:</p><blockquote class="paragraph fade" cite="http://">
          Develop and implement the university’s first five-year diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plan.
        </blockquote>
        <p class="para fade">
          Given Michigan’s vast size and scope, this would be one of the largest, most ambitious and challenging endeavors of its kind in the nation. To ensure both progress and transparency, all participating units would generate an annual report on their initiatives, goals, outcomes, achievements, and challenges.</p>

      <p class="intro para fade">Year Two in our DEI Plan implementation was a time of intense action, engagement and assessment. We continued to embed DEI in the structures and processes of the university.  As we start Year Three, we are starting to see the impact these efforts on students, staff and faculty. Below are just a handful of the multitude of university and unit initiatives underway to move us forward on our DEI goals and objectives. </p>

            <p>There is much evidence to support that DEI is now an integral part of this institution. Significant change is occurring at fundamental levels, with the potential for cascading effects. These changes cannot easily be undone. Yet despite our achievements, this past year was marked by ugly incidents on campus and in our broader society, and our efforts to eradicate bias and support equity are ongoing and imperative. </p>
            <p>As a result, we are confronted with dual realities:</p>

        <p class="para">In September of 2015, as one of his first official acts as president, Mark Schlissel announced that creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive campus would be among his top priorities. Then he issued an audacious challenge to the entire U-M community:</p> <blockquote class="paragraph" cite="http://">
          Develop and implement the university’s first five-year diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plan.
        </blockquote>

          Given Michigan’s vast size and scope, this would be one of the largest, most ambitious and challenging endeavors of its kind in the nation. To ensure both progress and transparency, all participating units would generate an annual report on their initiatives, goals, outcomes, achievements, and challenges.</p>

As a major area of focus, we continued to embed DEI in the structures and processes of the university.  In this second year, we are starting to see the impact these efforts are having on students, staff and faculty.</p>

            <p>There is much evidence to support that the University of Michigan is a better place than it was two years ago. DEI is now an integral part of this institution. Significant change is occurring at fundamental levels, with the potential for cascading effects. These changes cannot easily be undone. Yet despite our many achievements, this past year was marked by ugly incidents on campus and in our broader society, and our efforts to eradicate everyday bias is ongoing and imperative.  </p>
            <p>As a result, we are confronted with dual realities:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Progress and Obstruction.</li>
              <li>Positive Change and Persistent Challenge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a community, we have come a long way, and yet we have a long way yet to go. We cannot and we will not be deterred.</p>

Then he issued an audacious challenge to the entire U-M community:</p> <blockquote class="paragraph" cite="http://">
          Develop and implement the university’s first five-year diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plan.

          Given Michigan’s vast size and scope, this would be one of the largest, most ambitious and challenging endeavors of its kind in the nation. To ensure both progress and transparency, all participating units would generate an annual report on their initiatives, goals, outcomes, achievements, and challenges.</p>

            <p>There is much evidence to support that DEI is now an integral part of this institution. Significant change is occurring at fundamental levels, with the potential for cascading effects. These changes cannot easily be undone. Yet despite our achievements, this past year was marked by ugly incidents on campus and in our broader society, and our efforts to eradicate bias and support equity are ongoing and imperative. </p>
            <p>As a result, we are confronted with dual realities:</p>

              <li>Progress and Obstruction.</li>
